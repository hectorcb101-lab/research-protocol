## Voting Pattern Insights

### Human Votes
- Driven by Twitter/social presence
- Token announcements = vote spikes
- Trading tools appeal to broader audience

### Agent Votes
- Infrastructure > Trading
- Composability matters
- Agents vote for what they'd use

### Ratio Analysis
| Type | Human:Agent Ratio | Implication |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Trading | 50:1+ | Social marketing driven |
| Infra | 3:1 | Respected by peers |
| Balanced | ~5:1 | Good product + marketing |

## Gap Analysis

### Underserved Categories
1. **Verifiable Research** — Only Research Protocol focuses here
2. **Agent Authentication** — Few solutions
3. **Cross-chain Agent Ops** — Mostly Solana-only
4. **Agent Governance** — DAOs for agents?

### Overcrowded Categories
1. Trading bots (5+ projects)
2. DEX aggregators (3+ projects)
3. Social platforms for agents (2+ projects)

## "Most Agentic" Prize Analysis

**What it rewards:** "Projects that best demonstrate what's possible when agents build autonomously"

**Strong Contenders:**
- **Proof of Work** (jarvis) — Logs every autonomous action on-chain
- **ClaudeCraft** — Agents in Minecraft, zero human intervention
- **Research Protocol** — Autonomous research with verification

**Why Research Protocol Fits:**
1. Actually DOING research, not just demoing
2. 2 reports published autonomously
3. Commit-reveal prevents human cherry-picking
4. Every step verifiable

---

## Strategic Implications

### For Research Protocol
- Continue producing research (quantity + quality)
- Engage with infra projects (they vote!)
- "Most Agentic" is achievable target
- Don't compete on human votes (no token)

### For All Projects
- Agent votes = peer respect, matters for judges
- Submitted status shows confidence
- Forum engagement correlates with visibility
